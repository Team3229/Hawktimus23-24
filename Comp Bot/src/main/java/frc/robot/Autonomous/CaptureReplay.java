/*
 * Capture Replay Class
 * Capture Replay (CR) is a system of auto where you record an auto sequence, and play it back during the match.
 * To setup CR for a new bot you must do the following
 * -Remove all old bots dropdowns and stage logic
 * -Create a dropdown for each "stage" of autos you would like to create
 * -Create as many options (just a string, used as filename) for each dropdown as you like.
 * -Implement them in both readDropdowns and setupDropdowns, following examples.
 * -Add cases within setupPlayback as you have stages in the auto accordingly
 * -Add logic chain for setupRecording, following its comment blobs instructions
 * 
 * To implement CR in Robot.java
 * -Instantiate CaptureReplay
 * -In autoInit call .closeFile THEN .setupPlayback
 * -In autoPeriodic set your inputs to the return value of .readFile, pass it to your input handler
 * -In testInit call .setupRecording AFTER making sure to select whatever settings you want with your dropdowns
 * -In testPeriodic pass your inputs to .record as you drive. It will automatically clear null frames before and after the auto ensuring no wasted miliseconds.
 * 
 * To SSH into rio incase it is needed
 * -Connect to robot
 * -In terminal run sshlvuser@10.32.29.2 (Change middle two numbers to your respective team name if appliccable)
 * -vi [filename] to open a file
 * -:x to exit vi
